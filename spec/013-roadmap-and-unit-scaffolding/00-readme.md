# 013 — Roadmap + Unit Scaffolding

## Goal

Create a project-level overview/roadmap doc in `spec/` and scaffold the next spec units (006+) so future implementation work is broken into acceptance-criteria-driven chunks.

## Acceptance criteria

- `spec/01-overview.md` exists and explains how the project works end-to-end.
- Existing spec units (001–005) have a concise work-item roadmap document.
- New spec unit folders exist for the next Phase 1/2 work (006–012) with `00/01/02` files.
- The authoritative unit index in `spec/00-readme.md` includes the new units.
