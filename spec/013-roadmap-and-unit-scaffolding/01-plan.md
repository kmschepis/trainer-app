1. Review existing specs and `.github/instructions` requirements.
2. Write a single top-level overview/roadmap doc in `spec/`.
3. Add per-unit work-item roadmaps for completed units.
4. Scaffold new numbered spec units for the next Phase 1/2 work.
5. Update the `spec/00-readme.md` unit index.
6. Record changes in `02-execution.md`.
