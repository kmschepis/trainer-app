# 010 — Plan

1. Define which events are needed for the weekly review:
   - `SetLogged`
   - optional `BodyMetricLogged` (weight)
2. Extend state projection with:
   - weekly aggregates
   - e1RM estimate for a selected lift
   - weight trend (simple moving average)
3. Add a web route/page to display the review.
4. Verify by creating sample events and checking the UI.
