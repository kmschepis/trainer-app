# 001 — Init (Spec + Stack Baseline)

## Goal

Establish the initial product spec, architecture boundaries, and stack baseline that future work units build on.

## Inputs / references

- `001-Initial_plan.md` — overall product spec + architecture + Phase plan
- `002-deep_research.md` — research notes / references

## Acceptance criteria

- The project “walking skeleton” plan and stack are clearly defined.
- Service boundaries are explicit (web / api / agent) and the event-sourcing intent is recorded.
- Any deviations from the baseline stack are written down as explicit decisions.

## Notes

This unit is documentation-oriented; implementation work should go into dedicated execution units (e.g., Phase 0 / Phase 1).
