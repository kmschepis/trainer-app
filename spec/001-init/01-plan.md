# 001 — Plan

1. Review `001-Initial_plan.md` and confirm the locked MVP stack + Phase 0 acceptance tests.
2. Review `002-deep_research.md` and extract only decisions that matter (avoid copying external templates).
3. Record any open questions as explicit follow-ups (new units if needed).
4. Ensure `00-readme.md` acceptance criteria still match reality.
