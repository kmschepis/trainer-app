# 014 — Execution Log

- Created unit scaffold.
- Added Tailwind scaffolding to the Next.js app (`globals.css`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.js`).
- Added `lucide-react` and Tailwind dependencies.
- Replaced the web homepage with a chat-first coach console UI (no A2UI/actions panes).
- Updated roadmap docs to prioritize this chat UI work before onboarding/plan generation.
- Updated the API websocket chat path to default to a built-in stub coach (no agent/LLM required).
