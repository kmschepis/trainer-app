# 014 — Plan

1. Add Tailwind CSS to the Next.js app.
2. Add a minimal icon set for the chat UI (optional, but improves polish).
3. Replace the current debug homepage with a chat-first coach console UI.
4. Keep the existing WS contract and session handling.
5. Verify locally:
   - stack boots (`make run`)
   - web connects to WS
   - user can send and receive messages
